As long as you have not updated you won't be able to make use of that functionality in the tool.\r\n\r\n### Capabilities support\r\n\r\nWith the release of Mendix Native Mobile Builder, included when installing Mendix Studio Pro 8.15 or later, we are introducing a new approach in linking dependencies. \r\n\r\nWhile previous versions  of Native Template would have all core dependencies linked by default; for example an app would have Firebase even though it is not using any functionality; with the new approach we are building on top of React Native's auto linking behaviour and extending it a step further.\r\n\r\nWe gathered all core functionalities and grouped them under the platform specific `capabilities.*.json`  files. With a simple boolean toggle Native Template is able to link the required dependencies for the enabled capability, even the non auto-linkable ones. This happens as part of the pod installation for iOS and building on Android. After each change to this files remember to run `pod install` and build your Android project, so that the new files can be generated.\r\n\r\nSome steps, like the inclusion of the Google Service configuration, or the google map api, are still manual, if you are building locally.\r\nIf you would like to further simplify these steps consider using the Mendix Native Mobile Builder to just configure your project and build your project however you like. \r\n",

        "draft": false,
        "prerelease": true,
        "body": "### Breaking change\r\nWhile playing with our new capabilities support we identified some shortcomings.\r\nIn the initial implementation we thought of both platforms as a single configuration. \"Less is more\" they say, but in this particular case, less was too limiting. Therefor this update brings the splitting of the `capabilities.json` file to two new files, `capabilities.android.json`, and `capabilities.ios.json`. This allows the toggling of capabilities as needed for each platform.\r\n\r\n#### What does that mean for Native Mobile Builder users: \r\nIf you are using the Native Mobile Builder. Make sure you are using 0.9.x or later and there's nothing to fear, the builder will take care of things when re-building your project.\r\n\r\n#### What does that mean for advance tinkerers:\r\nIf you are building locally, keep in mind that for enabling the needed capabilities the respective files for each platform need to be modified.\r\nIn addition, **on iOS**,  you will need to run `pod install`, as code generation is a sub-step of the pod installation flow. \r\n\r\n### Push notification support for Native Mobile Builder\r\nOn top of that functionality, we introduced Push Notifications support with just a few clicks. \r\n\r\nJump into the Capabilities page and enable Push Notifications. Setup your Google Service configuration files, build and the new app should have Push Notifications configured.\r\n\r\n**Offline tinkerers**\r\nEnable the push notification capability for the platform you want by editing the appropriate `capabilities.*.json`, add the Google Service configuration file for each platform as advised by the platform's documentation and you are good to go.\r\n\r\n### Improvements\r\n- Added support for XCode 12.\r\n- Added missing iPad icons, that would lead to apps being rejected when committed to TestFlight.\r\n- Enabled legacy storage support to allow for some failing file operations to work correctly on Android 10 and later.\r\n- Fixed a bug in our generator logic, that would lead to local Android builds to fail when running on Windows.",

As soon as you include a Google services configuration file (GoogleService-Info.plist* and *google-services.json* in your app, the Native Template will enable the required libraries automatically.\r\n\r\n* Added support for URL Schemes.\r\n\r\n### Fixes\r\n\r\n* Bridging Headers should now work as intended and not collide when building.\r\n* Swift compiler incompatibilities should not occur anymore with new versions of XCode.\r\n* React Native link command should now work as intended for both platforms.\r\n",
