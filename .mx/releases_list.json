Some APIs or third-party modules might need adjustments to maintain functionality.  \r\n- **Library Migration:**  \r\n  - **@react-native-community/async-storage** has been replaced by **@react-native-async-storage/async-storage**. Ensure your imports and project dependencies reflect this change.  \r\n  - **@react-native-community/masked-view** has been replaced by **@react-native-masked-view/masked-view**. Update your references accordingly.  \r\n\r\n### PopupMenu Component\r\n\r\nThe PopupMenu component in the updated Native Mobile Resources module includes a breaking change.\r\nThis issue only affects projects that are:\r\n  * Upgrading from Mendix versions below 10.17 to 10.17 or higher, and\r\n  * Updating the Native Mobile Resources module to its latest version.\r\n\r\nWhat You Need to Do\r\n\r\nAfter updating the Native Mobile Resources module, you will encounter the following warning in Studio Pro:\r\n\r\n> *\"The definition of this widget has changed. Update this widget by right-clicking it and selecting 'Update widget,' or select 'Update all widgets' to update all widgets in the app.\"*\r\n\r\n1. Right-click on the warning in Studio Pro.\r\n1. Select Update All Widgets to apply the necessary updates.\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 🛠️ Important Actions  \r\n- **Native Mobile Resources and Nanoflow Commons Module:**  \r\n  The **Native Mobile Resources Module** and **Nanoflow Commons Module** in the Mendix App Store needs to be updated within your Mendix projects. This update ensures compatibility with the latest React Native version and library upgrades.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThese updates ensure a smoother, more stable experience on both Android and iOS while maintaining compatibility with the latest operating system features and performance improvements.",
