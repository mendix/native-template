        "body": "### Breaking Change\r\n\r\n- We bumped the `react-native-image` internal dependency to version `4.0.3` and introduced the `react-native-permissions` dependency. Developers would need to update their `NativeMobileResources` module from the App Store to the latest version to avoid unexpected behaviours. Due to this change, developers previously relying on Over-The-Air updates for their apps would have to release new applications to the app store.\r\n\r\n[Read more on the API 30 requirent for Google Play](https://developer.android.com/distribute/play-policies#APILevel30)\r\n\r\n### Improvements\r\n\r\n- We made an improvement to the the capability configurations. We added an Implementation for the `appCenterOTA` capability. This removes the previous need to have `Codepush` bundled with every application even when Over-The-Air support is not enabled via the Native Mobile App Builder.\r\n- We implemented support for Android 11 devices.\r\n- We bumped `react-native-codepush` dependency to `6.4.1` due to security concerns on the previous version.\r\n",

For more information, see [How to Create a Custom Developer App](/howto/mobile/how-to-devapps) and [How to Set Up Deep Links in Native Mobile Apps](/howto/mobile/native-deep-link).\r\n\r\n### Breaking Change\r\n\r\nOn iOS, there are now two implementations of `AppDelegate.m.`: one for release apps, and one for developer apps. The more features we added, the more boilerplate we had to add to support the more complex requirements of custom developer apps. By splitting the implementation, release apps now receive a clean and simple implementation with the more complex implementation abstracted away. \r\n\r\nThis should make it easier to add custom code by simply following a dependency's documentation. \r\n\r\nPlease note that if your app requires custom initialization, for example, due to third-party dependencies, and you plan to test the implementation using custom developer apps, from this version and higher **you must duplicate that custom work** in the AppDelegate (found in `Dev/AppDelegate.m`).**",
